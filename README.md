## About Git

Git is an extremely powerful tool for digital collaboration.

The way this works is anyone edits a file, then "pushes" that file to upload it to the server.

Next, anyone can "pull" from their end and the files they haven't edited and new filed they don't have will be updated.
Git is more careful with edited files, so as to not overwrite changes.

This allows for scalable collaboration on enormous projects.
There are also several other advantages associated with git that are not available elsewhere.

*Anyone can edit any file (even this one!).*

## QuickStart

 - Create a github account if you don't already have one.
 - Request permission from the owner of the repo, Charles Strauss (contact info above).

 - Download this repo to your computer by running the following command: ```git clone https://github.com/CharlesSS07/BClubRepo.git```.

   - You may need to install the git utility before this.

 - A folder labelled BClubRepo will appear inside the folder you are currently in. This contains everything up to date.

 - run "git add \<file\>" on \<file\> to upload it, then ```git commit -m <message>``` with message \<message\> and ```git push``` to send the updates to the server for everyone to access.

 - Periodically run ```git pull``` to update everything.

## Concepts

Linking is a useful tool in blender which allows an object from one file to appear in other files without the need to update every other file it is in. This way, someone can edit one file, and the changes will automatically appear in all others.

Please make files that correspond to a predefined naming convention:
 - Put your initials on the names of files and directories you create.
 - Use snake case: (underscores between words and no spaces).
 - Place files in the folder corresponding to the year they are made and the project they are part of.
