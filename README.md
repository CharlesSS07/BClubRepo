# BClubRepo

This is a git repo for the bclub projects. The way this works, is everyone edits a files, then does a "push" on that file, uploading it to the server. Next, everyone else can do a "pull" on their end, and files they haven't touched will be updated. This allows for scalable colaboration on enormous projects. I want to use it because it means we can now work from any computer, with ease. There are also several other advantages associated with git that are not avaliable elsewhere.

BTW, you can even edit this file.

If you have any questions, feel free to dm me on discord. Below is the basic git usage. You'll need a terminal for this, and it can work on windows.

<b>Instructions for installing repo:</b>
First, you must create a github account. Next, I should be able of adding you to our repo.

To install this repo, type "git clone https://github.com/CharlesSS07/BClubRepo.git". Im not sure if git comes installed on windows, but the error should be obvious enough.

This should help to understand git: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

The repo will appear in a folder labelled BClubRepo. I recommend running the mentioned command in the home directory on your computer.

Next, you will see the folder for this years projects. Withing that folder are folders for each project. Linking is a concept in blender, that allows you to have object from other files emvedded in one file. This way, someone can edit one file, and the changes will propogate to all others.

Finally, you should make files that coorespond to a predefined naming convention. We will use CammelCase. When you save a blender file, save it with this convension to the repo folder in the correct year.
