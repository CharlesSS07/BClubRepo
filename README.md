## How git works:

Git is an extremely powerful tool for digital colaboration.<br>
The way this works is anyyone edits a file, then "pushes" on that file, uploading it to the server.
Next, anyyone can "pull" on their end and the files they haven't editted will be updated.
Git is more careful with editted files, so as to not overwrite changes.
<br><br>
This allows for scalable colaboration on enormous projects.
There are also several other advantages associated with git that are not avaliable elsewhere.
<br>
<b>Anyone can edit any file (even this one!).</b>

## QuickStart

First, you must create a github account.
Anyone can view the repo, but to add to it, you will need access, so talk to the owner (Charles Strauss).
Contact info is at the top of this file.
<br>
To downlad this repo to your computer, use the terminal to run "git clone https://github.com/CharlesSS07/BClubRepo.git".
You may need to install the git utility.
<br>
The repo will appear in a folder labelled BClubRepo inside whatever folder you are currently in.

Next, you will see the folder for this years projects. Withing that folder are folders for each project. Linking is a concept in blender, that allows you to have object from other files emvedded in one file. This way, someone can edit one file, and the changes will propogate to all others.

Finally, you should make files that coorespond to a predefined naming convention. We will use snake_case. When you save a blender file, save it with this convension to the repo folder in the correct year.
